Rebooting this Site
===================

I'm rebooting this site now with tinkerer_ and some patches to the
"flat" html theme of tinker. I've not been able to blog much in the
past years, so the old content is not much and therefore I deem it not
really worth migrating. Anybody (against expectations) still
interested in the older stuff can find it in one of the branches in
the `github repository of this site`_.

Why do I even bother, if I blog so rarely? Well -- for once it has
been part of my new year's resolutions to write more. I have profited
much (in terms of personal development, in terms of understanding
certain subjects better) by writing, even when only to myself (some
people call that a diary). While not all of what I write will be
published in this blog, I think a blog, writing for a (potentially)
large, but largely unknown, readership is a good way to impose a
certain kind of discipline in one's writing.

And yes, I'm aware of the fact that most blogs have hardly any
readership (as evidenced by zero comments under their posts). It's not
that I don't care, but I don't care so much: As I just said, the major
advantage for me currently seems to be the different mindset imposed
on the writer.

This time everything will be different. Tinkerer_ is based on
Sphinx_. I've already been in the process to develop my own blogging
system based on Sphinx_ when I discovered Tinkerer_. So, of course,
Tinkerer_ it was. I don't agree with all design decisions of
Tinkerer_. But it works *now*, which is much better than a blogging
engine that needs to be developed first before I can start
writing. And if I ever migrate away from Tinkerer_, instead of just
extending it, I expect that not to be so painful as for the last
migrations. Mostly because I think that `reStructuredText`_ (and that
is for me: Sphinx_) is really the way to for the foundation of a
blogging engine.

At least for me. I don't want fancy WYSIWYG editors (I see what I get
pretty good when I invoke my web browser, thank you), I don't need
online editing -- rather I want the ability to write offline (meaning:
in any text editor or something that is supported on my Smartphone)
and to version control on my texts. I also want to be able to extend
the format, I want to write math, I want to render to PDF and I want
easy cross referencing.

All that are areas where `reStructuredText`_ excels. As an additional
boon there is the recommonmark_ extension for Sphinx_ which makes it
possible to write in markdown (but no math, mind you).

All in all going with something Sphinx_ base sounds like a solution
where I won't have to convert my texts every other year (knocking on
wood).

# Switching to Blogofile

Two weeks ago I changed the way this blog is maintained (if "maintained" is the right word
for the current low frequency of posts).

- Previously I've been using [Jekyll] and pages were generated server side on the github
  servers. There were no comments.

- Now I'm using [Blogofile] and pages are generated locally. Comments are supported via
  [Disqus].

# Still not satisfied

I'm still not satisfied. Why? There are two aspects: I don't like [Disqus], not because it
is technically inferior (it is not), but more for philosphical/political reasons. This -
in time - merits a separate article. The other points is, that [Blogofile] - somehow -
doesn't make me happy. 

Somehow the chemistry is not right, but I don't quite know why. [Blogofile] doesn't
enthuse me, but I have difficulties to put my finger on the exact reason. If there is one
thing I've learned in over 25 years of using and writing software (yes, has been this
long) it is *to trust my gut instinct*. If my gut instinct tells me, something is not
quite right, it is not quite right.

Fortunately I'm not doing this blog for a client (or employer), but for myself and for
fun, so I'm free to change technology whenever I'm feeling like it.

My next attempt will probably be [Nikola]. Wish me luck, that the romance with [Nikola]
will turn out to last a bit longer.
